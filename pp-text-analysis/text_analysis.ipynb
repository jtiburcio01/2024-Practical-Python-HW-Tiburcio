This degree typically takes 2\\nyears to achieve.\\n\\nSenior colleges or universities provide students with a Bachelor\\'s degree, which takes 4 years of\\nfull-time study to complete. Students who graduate from community colleges with an\\nAssociate’s Degree can then transfer to senior colleges to work towards their bachelor’s degree\\nfor an additional 4 years. As a result, it will take students 6 years to complete both their\\nAssociate’s and Bachelor’s degree.\\n\\nJohn Jay College of Criminal Justice (JUC) — a senior college of The City University of New York\\n(CUNY) — has evolved into the preeminent international leader in educating for justice in its many\\ndimensions. The College offers a rich liberal arts and professional curriculum that prepares\\nstudents to serve the public interest as ethical leaders and engaged citizens. The College is\\ndedicated to educating traditionally underrepresented groups and committed to increasing\\ndiversity in the workforce. With a community of over 15,000 students, in an array of\\nundergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs, John Jay College is the most diverse among\\nthe City University of New York’s senior colleges. The student body — 60% female 40%\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_22\\nDataKind\\n\\nHispanic and 25% African American — today produces leaders, scholars and heroes in policing\\nand beyond, including forensic science, law, fire and emergency management, social work,\\nteaching, private security, forensic psychology and corrections.\\n\\nThe Challenge\\n\\nAcross the United States, 4-year graduation rates for transfer students who move from\\ncommunity college to a senior (4 year) institution are poor. Data from the American Institutes for\\nResearch shows that only about 60% of college students graduate from four-year colleges and\\nuniversities within six years\\'. Additionally, the longer students stay in a community college, the\\nless likely they are to transfer to a 4 year university, therefore blocking their academic path to\\ngraduating with a degree from a senior institution.\\n\\nWhile John Jay College has the highest transfer graduation rate of any NYC higher education\\ninstitution (in and outside of the CUNY system), identifying individuals who could benefit from an\\nintervention to support their academic path to increase student graduation rates is time\\nconsuming and resource intensive.\\n\\nCurrently, no data pipeline or tool exists to provide student-level information on the junior to\\nsenior college transfer program, where the students come from (i.e. which community college),\\nand where they might need additional support in order to graduate from the 4 year program\\nwithin 6 years.\\n\\nThe Opportunity\\n\\nDataKind would like to work in partnership with the John Jay College (JJC) team to use\\nstudents’ information prior to and after transferring to John Jay College in order to predict which\\ntransfer students are most at risk of not graduating. John Jay will, in turn, offer these students\\nadditional support toward completing their degrees, enabling the solid foundation of a\\nBachelor’s Degree to strengthen their stability and future economic well being.\\n\\nSpecifically, the tool will aim to generate data driven insights into which students might be at\\nhighest risk of not completing their degree, and when the intervention(s) would need to take\\nplace (e.g., the semester before they transfer, the summer before, throughout the first academic\\nyear at JJC etc.). The specific nature of the intervention(s) taken is not in scope of this project,\\nand will be addressed by the subject-matter experts within JJC, based in part on already\\nexisting and successful intervention programs at JJC.\\n\\n\\' Source:\\nhttps://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/the-catch-22-of-community-college-grad\\nuation-rates\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_23\\nDataKind\\n\\nDataKind Problem Statement\\n\\nUsing student demographic and enrollment information from 2005 - 2021, student performance\\ninformation prior to enrollment at John Jay, and student performance information after\\nenrollment at John Jay College, DataKind aims to create a model that will provide the John Jay\\nteam (academic advisors, financial aid counselors) with data-driven information to identify\\ntransfer students who have defined risk characteristics so that they can receive direct support to\\nhelp ensure their academic success\\n\\nThe model will generate the probability of a transfer student not completing their degree (with an\\nemphasis on completion within six years) based on historical data provided and machine\\nlearning algorithms, and will also provide recommendations on when this risk is highest (e.g.,\\nsemester or summer pre-transfer, first transfer semester etc.). This will allow the CUNY team to\\ndirectly support students most at-risk of not graduating, ensuring that transfer students from\\nassociates programs will graduate from John Jay College’s baccalaureate programs within the\\nprescribed 6 years.\\n\\nBackground and Context: Previous DataKind Partnership\\n\\nDataKind previously partnered with John Jay College at CUNY to build a predictive model using\\nJohn Jay’s data to identify students with advanced standing who are at risk of dropping out.\\nLeveraging historical student data, the DataKind DataCorps team used statistical analysis and\\nmachine learning to understand and identify factors that may affect students’ decisions to drop\\nout after having completed 90 credits (75 percent of the credits needed to earn a degree) [see\\nprevious project plan here, the final project presentation video here, and the final project\\npresentation deck here].\\n\\nFor each student with a given set of characteristics recorded in the data, the model computed a\\ndropout risk score. This allowed the John Jay administration to identify students with a high risk\\nof dropping out early on. The statistical analysis also revealed student characteristics that are\\nmost likely to be associated with the decision to drop out. This analysis helped inform the design\\nof effective interventions for the population of students at risk to help reduce dropout and\\nimprove graduation rates.\\n\\nThis model is at the heart of the JJC’s Completion for Upper-division Student Program (CUSP). 5\\nyears after the kick start of the intervention, 4-year graduation rates are 41% for the first time in\\ncollege history. At the start of this project, graduation rates were closer to 25%.\\n\\nThe existing model is currently being run effectively by a small team, using Jupyter notebooks.\\nThis process involves data extraction from  source-systems, data wrangling in\\nnon-project-controlled SAS scripts, execution of the project code in notebooks, and the further\\nSAS (or other language) work to prepare the outputs for use by the team. Some or all of this pipe\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_24\\nDataKind\\n\\ncould be consolidated into a robust data pipeline within this project, for either the transfers or for\\nall student types.\\n\\nFurther understanding and reviewing the way in which this CUSP tool is used and the general\\napproach to its implementation will be necessary to build a similarly sustainable product\\ngenerating risk scores for transfer students specifically.\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_25\\nDataKind\\n\\nSCHEDULE B\\n\\nDataKind has engaged the following volunteers for this project:\\n\\nJay Shah\\n\\nAnuja Mahashabde\\nShreyash Suryawanshi\\nKaveri Nadhamuni\\nPrakrit Baruah\\n\\nKhizer Asad\\n\\nMoiz Ali\\n\\nFelicia Edwards\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_26\\nAPPENDIX A\\n\\nSTANDARD CLAUSES FOR NEW YORK STATE CONTRACTS\\n\\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS DOCUMENT\\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE.\\n\\nCUNY ICA - NYS Appendix - October 2019 6\\n\\n\\n## DataKindAgreements__page_27\\nSTANDARD CLAUSES FOR NYS CONTRACTS\\n\\nThe parties to the attached contract, license, lease,\\namendment or other agreement of any kind (hereinafter,\\n\"the contract\" or \"this contract\") agree to be bound by the\\nfollowing clauses which are hereby made a part of the\\ncontract (the word \"Contractor\" herein refers to any party\\nother than the State, whether a contractor, licenser,\\nlicensee, lessor, lessee or any other party):\\n\\n1.
